# Hello, i'am Sascha!

Hi there, my name is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/r3sMetz">Sascha Metz</a>. Iam a 31 year old developer from Germany.
I build Websites since 2012 and iam working as developer fulltime since 2015. During my journery i built websites mostly using WordPress or CodIgniter.
Nowadays i prefer GatsbyJS. In my free-time i enjoy playing guitar, keeping myself fit and listening to music.

In terms of the requirements for the job, i would say that the only thing i cannot deliver right now is knowledge in Laravel and Apline.js.

## What i expect

I spent most of my dev-years as the companies only dev and i miss working with a team.
I enjoy developing with TailwindCSS and working with the Tailwind Team would be absolutley amazing!

Also, living abroad for at least some time is one of my life-goals. So i even see myself moving to Canada (or Michigan, because i have relatives there), if the opportunity comes.

I dropped out of university for being a dev and i don't wan't to work for companies in which i only work for the sake of work.
Working with passion and a reason is very important to me and i think you folks would be a perfect match for this.

And i am also a listener of Slayer üòÅ

## What i did here

For my application i've tried to implement a proof of concept for one of the tasks in the job description. I started implementing the Docs with NextJS and MDX.
What you see now is everything i got done within the available time. As always in code, it seems not much at the front, but i've already learned a lot here. üôÇ

I tried to built the thing from scratch, with looking up the original code as little as possible. One of the things i had to use from the original code was the concept of slots ... i miss that in React üòÖ

You can find the repo via the github icon on the top-right corner. You can also find a storybookJS there.
